# Cargar los conjuntos de datos
questions <- read.csv("questions.csv")
answers <- read.csv("answers.csv")
tags <- read.csv("tags.csv")
question_tags <- read.csv("question_tags.csv")

# 1. Left-joining questions and tags
questions_with_tags <- left_join(questions, question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id"))
questions_with_tags <- left_join(questions_with_tags, tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id"))
questions_with_tags$tag_name <- replace_na(questions_with_tags$tag_name, "only-r")

# 2. Comparing scores across tags
tag_scores <- questions_with_tags %>%
  group_by(tag_name) %>%
  summarize(mean_score = mean(score)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_score))

# 3. Finding gaps between questions and answers
#joined_data <- inner_join(questions, answers, by = c("id" = "question_id"), suffix = c("_question", "_answer"))
#joined_data <- joined_data %>% mutate(gap = creation_date_answer - creation_date_question)

joined_data$creation_date_question <- as.numeric(joined_data$creation_date_question)

joined_data <- joined_data %>% mutate(gap = creation_date_answer - creation_date_question)


# 4. Joining question and answer counts
answer_counts <- answers %>%
  count(question_id) %>%
  arrange(question_id)

question_answer_counts <- left_join(questions, answer_counts, by = c("id" = "question_id"))
question_answer_counts$n <- replace_na(question_answer_counts$n, 0)

# 5. Joining questions, answers, and tags
combined_data <- inner_join(question_tags, question_answer_counts, by = "question_id")
combined_data <- inner_join(combined_data, tags, by = "tag_id")
